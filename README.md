### Formfields to add 

Please note that there are forms validations done and it is important that the submitted form from the website corresponds to what is specified in admin/in the system.

## Development

There is a builder included for generating the tailwind CSS file for production. With command `make` in the terminal it will build a new ouput.css file. The builder requires Podman or Docker (and the environment, Colima on Mac for example) to work.
